![Hugo](http://gohugo.io/img/hugo-logo.png)

I'm making a switch away from Octopress and giving [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) a try. Octopress went a long time without any updates and it was starting to feel a bit stale&mdash;of course, my blog is a bit stale anyway. They are in the process of a major release which is still based on Ruby. I have nothing against Ruby, but I went looking for something binary so I don't have the run-time dependency. I've mentioned [StaticGen](https://www.staticgen.com) before and so I went there to see what's popular. I started with filtering on [Go](https://golang.org/) because it's building in popularity for multi-platform projects and it compiles to an executable. No package managers required to handle a number of dependencies of which, no doubt, one won't work on Windows without some hacking.

I'm working to migrate the content.
